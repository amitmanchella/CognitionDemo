excerpt: "Side projects have taught me more than any course or tutorial. Here's my approach to building them effectively."

Side projects are the secret weapon of every great developer. They're how we learn new technologies, explore ideas, and sometimes even build businesses.

## Why Side Projects Matter

Every successful product I've shipped started as a side project. Here's why they're so valuable:

- **Low stakes experimentation** - Try new things without pressure
- **Portfolio building** - Show what you can do, not just what you've learned
- **Passion-driven learning** - Motivation comes naturally
- **Real-world experience** - Face actual problems, not textbook scenarios

## My Process

Over the years, I've developed a process that works:

### 1. Start Small

The graveyard of abandoned side projects is filled with overly ambitious ideas. Start with something you can finish in a weekend.

### 2. Solve Your Own Problem

The best side projects solve a problem you personally have. You'll understand the requirements deeply and stay motivated.

### 3. Ship Early

Don't wait until it's perfect. Ship a basic version and iterate based on feedback.

### 4. Set a Deadline

Without a deadline, projects expand forever. Give yourself two weeks and see what you can build.

## Current Side Project

Right now, I'm building a simple habit tracker. Nothing fancy—just a way to track daily habits and see streaks. It's using Next.js and stores data locally.

## Final Thoughts

The best time to start a side project is now. Pick something small, set a deadline, and start building. You'll learn more in a month of building than a year of tutorials.

What are you going to build?
